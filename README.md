# noware — Hardware Playground

Primary domain: https://noware.so

Direct GCP access while DNS caches update: https://noware-1010426969452.us-central1.run.app

GCP project: `noware-hardware`. Cloud Run is deployed at https://noware-1010426969452.us-central1.run.app. Cloudflare routing is configured and the zone is active. The dedicated Google OAuth client is configured on Cloud Run. Cloudflare Universal SSL is active and HTTPS/login-page checks pass at its current IPs. Some local DNS caches still resolve the old Namecheap parking address. Real-account sign-in and logout remain to be verified. Hosting is exclusively Google Cloud Run with Cloudflare routing. See [hosting setup](infrastructure/README.md).

Interactive PCB explorer and browser-based behavioral simulator, built from the actual [hyperchi/AirCube](https://github.com/hyperchi/AirCube) KiCad design.

## Use

- Search or click components to inspect positions, pad numbers, and nets.
- Highlight a net, flip the board, toggle traces/copper fills/labels, zoom, and drag to pan.
- Adjust TVOC, simulated true CO₂ (Pro), brightness, and power. Presets provide quick scenarios.
- Simulation settings persist in this browser. Export a scenario as JSON.
- Download original KiCad board and schematic files from the footer.

## Scope and provenance

The rendered board is **AirCube v1.1 Base**, extracted from upstream commit `bd857275c1f02efbec6942a96e433bde9d4d417e`: 52 footprints including mechanical/graphic items, 301 routed tracks, 53 vias, and 47 net entries. The source PCB does not contain the Pro sensors shown in the supplied schematic photographs. Pro inputs are virtual; switching model does not alter board geometry.

The renderer uses original pad positions/rotations, routing, vias, footprint linework, filled copper polygons, and edge cuts. It simplifies component body rendering and does not render custom footprint graphics/text or 3D STEP models. It is an explorer, not a PCB editor; changes do not modify manufacturing files.

`src/simulation.js` ports the TVOC and CO₂ threshold interpolation and worst-source selection from upstream `firmware/main/main.c`. Target hue follows the green-to-red firmware curve. Manual brightness is a visual approximation. This does **not** execute ESP32 firmware, solve electrical circuits, emulate sensor dynamics/warm-up, reproduce automatic ambient-light dimming or LED transition timing, or connect to live hardware. No AI credentials are required. Production sign-in uses a small server authentication endpoint. Scenario settings stay in browser local storage unless downloaded.

## Development

Requires Node 20.19+ or 22.12+ and Python 3 for regenerating board data.

```sh
npm ci
npm run dev
npm test
npm run build
python3 scripts/extract.py
node scripts/browser-check.mjs
```

The browser check requires Chrome and a running dev server. Set `TEST_URL` to check a deployed site. Cloud Run runs `node server.js` from the Dockerfile.

## Attribution

Original AirCube hardware and firmware by [StuckAtPrototype](https://github.com/StuckAtPrototype/AirCube), obtained through hyperchi/AirCube. Original source files retain their upstream content. The extracted data, renderer, and JavaScript simulation port are additions for this explorer. Distributed under Apache-2.0; see LICENSE.

Deploy using `./infrastructure/deploy-gcp.sh`; deploy Cloudflare routing with `npx wrangler@latest deploy --config infrastructure/wrangler.jsonc`.

## Noso and approved guest Google sign-in

Production routes are protected by the Express server on Cloud Run, including board JSON, bundles, and source downloads. Only the login page, login script, favicon, authentication endpoint, and health endpoint are public. The API verifies Google's RS256 signature, issuer, audience, freshness, email verification, exact `hd=noso.so`, and a browser-bound login nonce. Merely entering an email address never grants access.

Verified identities receive a signed HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Lax cookie lasting exactly 30 days (2,592,000 seconds). Expiry is fixed at sign-in, not extended by page visits. Sign out clears this browser's session. Changing `SESSION_SECRET` invalidates all sessions. Workspace membership is checked at sign-in; removing a Workspace account does not revoke an existing 30-day session immediately.

Required server-only Cloud Run environment variables:

- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`: OAuth web client in the dedicated noware project.
- `SESSION_SECRET`: independently generated random secret, at least 32 characters.
- `APP_ORIGIN`: `https://noware.so`.
- `ADDITIONAL_AUTH_ORIGINS`: `https://noware-1010426969452.us-central1.run.app` (legacy OAuth allowlist; browser visits to the direct GCP URL now redirect to the canonical domain).

Google Auth Platform lists both `https://noware.so` and `https://noware-1010426969452.us-central1.run.app` under the client's **Authorized JavaScript origins**. No redirect URI or Google client secret is needed for this GIS callback flow. The browser receives only the public client ID and a short-lived nonce.

`npm run dev` is for local UI development without the authentication server. Run `npm run build && npm start` to exercise the server locally. The existing public source repository remains public. Run `node scripts/auth-browser-check.mjs` to check production authentication; a real Noso account must complete the final sign-in check.

## Branding and canonical URLs

The login and explorer use the visual language of noso.so: Inter, white grid backgrounds, neutral borders, square controls and blue accents. `public/favicon.ico` is the exact favicon served by noso.so (downloaded from its declared S3 icon URL).

`/login` serves sign-in; `/login.html` permanently redirects there. Direct `*.run.app` requests redirect to `https://noware.so` with the path and query preserved, except `/api/health`. The Cloudflare worker overwrites `X-Noware-Public-Host` so forwarded requests avoid a redirect loop. This header only controls URL redirects, never authentication. Deploy the worker before the server when changing this routing.

Guest access: `lib/auth-policy.js` permits the exact Google-verified Gmail address `shanshan0343@gmail.com` alongside verified `@noso.so` Workspace identities. Other Gmail accounts and aliases remain denied. Google audience must be External; the app enforces its own allowlist. The sign-in button has no hosted-domain account-picker filter. Guest sessions use the same 30-day signed, HttpOnly cookie.

## Design lab

The side panel includes a design study for current ESP32-H2 with a gateway, a Wi-Fi MCU replacement (ESP32-C3 candidate), or an added LTE-M modem + SIM. Select Base or Pro sensor configuration, reporting interval, payload, USB-C input current, board power, radio rail and supply capacity. Run an accelerated connection sequence, inject missing SIM/network/antenna and supply faults, compare options, save a baseline, and export a JSON study. State remains in local storage.

All numerical power/timing/throughput defaults are **editable illustrative assumptions**, not measurements or guaranteed part specifications. Duty cycle is capped at 100%; throughput limits produce a backlog. USB-C input power is modeled load divided by conversion efficiency; daily energy is input power × 24 hours. Peak input current is checked against the configured 5 V source budget. Failed attempts consume energy but deliver no data. Each report reconnects; weak signal models doubled connection/transfer time and one retry. Data estimates include configurable overhead and retries over 30 days. Carrier billing, TLS timing, RF, real firmware, detailed electrical behavior and physical PCB edits are not simulated.

Both Base KiCad and the user's Pro schematic photos label U7 ESP32-H2-MINI-1, which has BLE/802.15.4, not Wi-Fi. The Pro-only section adds SCD41 and VCNL4040; ENS210 is omitted. Pro selection changes the sensor configuration description, not the displayed Base layout or an invented measured power load: set the rest-of-board power from measurements. Unrouted signal pads are shown as candidates requiring review; NC pads are excluded. Manufacturer links in each option substantiate connectivity/module choices, not the illustrative numerical defaults.

Verification: `npm test`, then with local Vite running `TEST_URL=http://localhost:5175 node scripts/design-browser-check.mjs` and `TEST_URL=http://localhost:5175 node scripts/browser-check.mjs`.

Connection changes automatically focus the PCB front and highlight affected source components. Thread keeps U7; Wi-Fi marks U7 for replacement and U6 for power review; cellular keeps U7 and marks U6/P1 for power-budget review. Colored rings remain attached to KiCad component coordinates while zooming/panning. The caption lists proposed cellular additions without inventing their PCB placement. Air & LEDs clears the design overlay; returning to Design lab restores it.

## Component library and 3D

Open **Component library** in the header area or **View in 3D** in the inspector. All 44 Base PCB components are searchable by reference, value and footprint, with category filters, roles, footprint details and a Locate on board action. Rotate with drag, zoom with wheel/pinch, or use Top/Bottom/Reset.

37 components use CAD-backed geometry: official Espressif ESP32-H2-MINI-1 STEP and package/LED models extracted from the original AirCube STEP assembly. Seven components (P1, S2, S3, TP2, U2, U6, U10) use visibly labeled simplified models from footprint pad positions and approximate bodies. Generic package CAD does not establish the exact vendor, height or markings for all values. These are individual part views, not a claimed complete 3D board assembly. Pro-only sensors are absent from this Base catalog.

Source attribution, license terms and transformation notes are in `public/models/README.md`. Espressif geometry is CC BY-SA 4.0 with the KiCad exception; see `ESPRESSIF-LICENSE.md`. Conversion uses occt-import-js at development time; the browser lazily loads Three.js, OrbitControls and preconverted geometry. Models remain protected by the existing login middleware. WebGL failure displays an explicit fallback message with component details available.

Run `node scripts/library-browser-check.mjs` against local Vite (default port 5175) to verify 3D, search, simplified labeling, locate, reopening, Escape and mobile layout. Rebuild geometry with `node scripts/prepare-component-models.mjs <AirCube.step> <ESP32-H2-MINI-1.STEP>`.

## Proposed connectivity options and USB-C power

The library includes two proposed solution entries separate from the 44 installed components: ESP32-C3-MINI-1 Wi-Fi and Quectel BG95 cellular + SIM. Each lists supporting hardware and offers Try in design lab, which selects the connection and highlights affected PCB components. Wi-Fi uses official Espressif CAD. BG95 uses a clearly labeled simplified 23.6 × 19.9 × 2.2 mm module envelope from the manufacturer specification; no invented pinout or placement. Supporting SIM/antenna/regulator parts are requirements, not a finalized BOM.

The design simulator is now USB-C-only. Legacy battery settings are removed when restoring saved state. Controls expose the 5 V source current budget, radio rail current/voltage and conversion efficiency. Results show USB input watts, Wh/day, average and peak input current, and headroom; neither battery runtime nor USB PD negotiation is modeled. The default 500 mA is an editable planning input, not a guarantee of any USB source. Supply availability must be established from the actual source, cable and advertised/negotiated capability.

## Deploy from GitHub

Push to `main` to validate and deploy automatically to https://noware.so on GCP. You can also use [Actions → Deploy noware to GCP](https://github.com/hyperchi/noware-exploer/actions/workflows/deploy-gcp.yml) and select **Run workflow** on `main`. Pull requests run checks without production access. Keyless GCP authentication and repository deployment variables are configured; the runtime login secret stays in Secret Manager. See `infrastructure/README.md` for permissions and deployment details.
